While building an Expo app, I encountered an unusual error related to the interaction between Expo's `Linking` API and the app's routing mechanism.  The app uses React Navigation, and when a deep link was opened, the navigation would not update correctly. The `Linking.addEventListener` would trigger, but the corresponding navigation action wouldn't happen or would be delayed. The error messages in the console were often vague, sometimes showing errors related to React Navigation but not directly pointing to the core issue.
